# Ph≈ìnix Dark

## VS Code theme with a minimal color palette, focused on values 

- All value types have the same vivid color;
- Colors for keywords / control characters / ponctuation etc. are muted;
- Optimised to work with the lit-html extension (js in html in js...).

### Javascript

### Javascript / HTML (lit-html)

Almost there: note the deepest div is not correctly highlighted as HTML, but as a normal string. Not sure whether this depends on lit-html extension or the language services... Hopefully this will be adressed soon!
