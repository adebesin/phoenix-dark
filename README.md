# Ph≈ìnix Dark

## Theme with a minimal color palette, focused on values 
- all value types have the same vivid color.
- colors for keywords / control characters / ponctuation etc. are muted. 
- Optimised to work with the lit-html extension (js in html in js...).

### javascript
almost there: note the deepest div is not correctly highlighted as HTML, but as a normal string. Not sure whether this depends on lit-html extension or the language services... Hopefully this will be adressed soon!
